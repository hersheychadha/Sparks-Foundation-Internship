# Spark-Foundation-Internship
This repository contains the tasks assigned during the one month internship at the sparks foundation. The tasks helped revisit basic data visualization concepts and reinforce the basics. The notebook titled task 2 revisits the linear regression models and utilizes them to predict student productivity. Task 2 and 3 work with the popular iris data set and apply to it data visualization and classification techniques. The last task which had to do with exploratory data analysis is illustrated in notebook titled task 5. Herein, ideas about what can be done with the dataset are presented. Morever some of these ideas have been brought to fruition and hard coded.
